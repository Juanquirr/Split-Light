## Tech Stack

![GodotLogo](https://godotengine.org/assets/logo_dark.svg)

This project is based on [Godot 4.4](https://godotengine.org/), a game engine with extensive capabilities for 2D games and broad support for 3D.

Godot has its own programming language (GDScript), which is easy to learn, with a low learning curve, and capable of providing a fast workflow in a short time.

## Screenshots

As game development progresses, we will add more game screenshots.
